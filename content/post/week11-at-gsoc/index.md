Hello and welcome back! In this blog post, I would like to share my progress during the 11th week of Google Summer of Code.

I have some exciting news!

## Progress [###########..]

**tl;dr:** This week has been amazing; my pull request got merged!

During this week, I worked on documenting the new test suite and made a few enhancements as reviewed by my mentor. For more information, take a look at the [review].

[review]: https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpmlint/pull/1101#pullrequestreview-1580023523

I opened my pull request way back in the 6th week or so. Since then, I have been committing all my changes to this single pull request. It wasn't until this week that I marked my pull request for review; previously, it was marked as a **Draft Pull Request**.

My pull request consists of 30 commits!

No sooner did I mark my pull request for review than it got merged. I owe many thanks to my mentor for helping me understand these concepts.

You can find my <i class="fa-solid fa-code-merge" style="color: #cb77e9;"></i> [pull request] here.

## Miscellaneous

- Only 4 more days to go until my visit to the SUSE office in Bangalore. I am so excited!
- Also, my final evaluation is about to start in just 3 days.
