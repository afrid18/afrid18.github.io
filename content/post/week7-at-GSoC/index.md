Hello Everyone, in this blog post, I would like to share my progress in the Google Summer of Code for week 7.


## Overview

During week 7, I spent most of my time learning Linux and the command line in much greater detail. Additionally, I delved into computer networking, even though it doesn't completely align with my GSoC project. However, I found it necessary to learn for some other purposes.


Okay, now let's see how far I've come in week 7.


## Progress [#######..........]

I dedicated most of my time to learning Linux fundamentals, and I came to appreciate the true depth and power of Linux. Previously, I only knew the basics of file management and package management. However, by delving deeper, I have now grasped a few more concepts in Linux. Still, I've only covered a quarter of the concepts in the Linux Operating System. I find this journey joyful and am eager to learn more.

Furthermore, I experimented with Neovim and Vim, and I started to feel the power of Vim. Although I began using Vim about 2 years ago, I never realized the extent of its capabilities. After watching a few tutorials, I learned basic navigation and text editing.

My mentor, [Daniel], showed me how to use Vim macros, as he is an experienced power user of Vim and Linux.


From the perspective of GSoC, I have been exploring other checks to work on. I discovered a few checks such as `DuplicatesCheck`, `TagsCheck`, and `FilesCheck`. I have started to look into `TagsCheck`, which is recommended by my mentor.

However, this requires modification to the existing `FakePkg` class. Let's see how I'm going to work on it.


## Misc

The exciting news for this week is that I might visit the SUSE office in Bangalore anytime soon. My mentor talked to the authorities and managed to arrange a visit, and the travel expenses will also be sponsored.

I will definitely post a dedicated blog post after my visit, so follow me on <i class="fa-brands fa-linkedin"></i> [LinkedIn] where I post most of my work about GSoC and other accomplishments.
