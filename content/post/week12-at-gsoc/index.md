Welcome back to the final weekly report of Google Summer of Code 2023 - it's Week 12!

I am feeling both happy and sad. Sad because GSoC is coming to an end, and happy because I have successfully completed my GSoC journey! Just a few hours ago, I submitted my GSoC Final Evaluation form.

This week has been amazing. I had the opportunity to visit the SUSE Office in Bangalore ðŸ¤©. I owe a big thank you to my mentor, [Daniel](https://danigm.net/), for providing me with this wonderful opportunity. I am extremely grateful. I understand that not everyone is fortunate enough to have such a good and kind mentor.

## Progress [############] : 12 Weeks DONE!

**_A Day to remember: August 24, 2023:_**

Firstly, I had the pleasure of meeting [Manu Dhir], The General Manager at SUSE India. He introduced me to [Sreejith Kumar], a Senior Technical Support Engineer at SUSE. He kindly showed me around the office, introduced me to a few of his teammates and their team manager.

By mistake, I occupied [Deepika Jaiswal]'s desk. It took me a while to realize that the desk was hers ðŸ˜…. After just 5 minutes of conversation with the other members, I felt comfortable. [Revanth Rangaraju] was a native language speaker, which made me feel even more at ease, and we had a nice chat too. I am grateful to [Revanth Rangaraju] for that.

I spent the entire day talking to a few other people. I would like to express my gratitude to each and every one of them for making my day memorable. Thank you [Manu Dhir], [Sreejith Kumar], [Deepika Jaiswal], [Revanth Rangaraju], [Manvi Kardam], and [Madhu Sudan].
