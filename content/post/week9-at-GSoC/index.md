Welcome back. In this blog post, I would like to share my Google Summer of Code weekly progress for week 9.

### week 9,

Yes, its week 9. I am already worried that GSoC is completing. GSoC has gave me lots of good experiences, first one to mention is my mentor **Daniel**, what a good person he is. I am all started to think I would miss video conferences with him after GSoC, but still I could atleast contact him via IRC. I am very grateful for having such a mentor. Thanks Daniel.

## Progress [#########......]

Well, this week I have worked on extending `FakePkg` class. which was especially for `DuplicatesCheck.py` test function. These weren't major changes, but still `FakePkg` is getting more capable to handle more types of tests, so thats a good improvement.

I have been working on `test_duplicates.py`, and was able to mock 2 tests and thats the total numnber of tests to mock, which means I completed mocking `test_duplicates.py`.

Since GSoC, I have mocked

- `test_binaries.py`
- `test_python.py`
- `test_duplicates.py`

The coming week, I will be working on `test_files.py` and other issues related to <i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i> GitHub actions workflow files.

In the previous blog post, I have mentioned that I will be visiting SUSE office Bangalore and I have decided on visiting SUSE office <i class="fa-solid fa-building"></i> on 24th of August.

I couldn't write much for this blog post, but this week was full of <i class="fa-solid fa-bug"></i> debugging nights, very painful.

<h1 style="text-align: center"> Thank You </h1>
